[Nokia Service Router Linux (SR Linux)](https://www.nokia.com/networks/products/service-router-linux-NOS) is a truly open network operating system (NOS) that makes your data center switching infrastructure more scalable, more flexible and simpler to operate.

SR Linux is a part of the [Nokia Data Center Fabric solution](https://www.nokia.com/networks/solutions/data-center-switching-fabric/) that has been designed from the ground up to free your cloud builder networking teams to rapidly design and deploy, easily adapt and integrate and confidently operate and automate data center network fabrics: at scale.

## Getting container image

Nokia made SR Linux container image publicly available to everyone with no registration, licensing or contract requirements. Simply do:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/nokia/srlinux
```

## Using container image
SR Linux container image is meant to be used in learning, demo, test and CI environments. To help newcomers to get to the grips of this new Network OS we created an open documentation resource - [learn.srlinux.dev](https://learn.srlinux.dev) which will guide you through all the steps required to successfully launch SR Linux container and create lab topologies with it.
